Greasefire2
==========

Greasefire2 is my try at reviving the original greasefire addon after the shutdown of userscripts.org and skrul.com.
Most of the work is from the original author skrul.

#### Downloads

The original Firefox extension can be downloaded at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasefire/
The new on will follow soon.

The Chrome extension is not yet complete, but grab the source and give it a try!
